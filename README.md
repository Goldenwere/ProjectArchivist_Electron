# Project Archivist

## About

Project Archivist is an Electron application used for creating batch script files that execute [7-Zip add commands](https://sevenzip.osdn.jp/chm/cmdline/commands/add.htm) to create archives primarily for file backup purposes.

## Origin

Project Archivist stems from the code written for a [Windows Form application of the same name](https://github.com/xLightling/ProjectArchivist_WinForms) that was created in under 24 hours. See [its origin](https://github.com/xLightling/ProjectArchivist_WinForms#origin) for more details.
